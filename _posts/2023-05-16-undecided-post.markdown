Ok lets do the first post. It has to be something easyish, not too hard where I just abbandon the blog after starting it cause its too hard. Not a good idea for first post. bad start no can do. Ok lets brain storm.

## Technology
- Rust: everyone loves it, I don't why? I want to know why?
- haskell: Sorta already learnt it but didn't really understand mondad, functor, etc

I think Rust should be the answer

## Ideas
- Pi approximation: I am going to post something about this sometime, but the first post i don't know
- Mandelbrot Set: I already have something done in python, maybe make it more effecient? maybe in Rust. now we are getting somewhere. Nothing better than not starting from scratch.

Ok i think I have got it. Mandlebrot set in rust. Lets do it!
