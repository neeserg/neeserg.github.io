Ok, its time to do another project. the focus is really quantity here. I think quality comes after quantity has been achieved. Next project I think I will do is a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm implemented in rust. Fast Fourier transform because I have never coded that up before, and rust. After all, that's the programming language that I am exploring ATM. This will be slightly harder than the last project last time because I have not really done this before. I like gymming and I am a huge fan of progressive overload. Adding a tiny bit of difficulty in each step is the best way to learn and grow.

Things I will need to master:
- Fast Fourier transforms algorithm itself.
- I need some thing to input into the fourier transform. Haven't thought of that yet.
- More understanding of rust is also needed. the book is a pretty great resource.
- I think it will take around 2 weeks to complete.

Let's gooooo!
