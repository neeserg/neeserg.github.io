I am the proud creator of this website. I am a software developer by profession and not very good at talking about myself. But I have made an entire website dedicated to me and my musing, so I guess I will have to do it 😮‍💨.

The content of this blog will generally be self-contained to the following topics:

- The intersection of maths and programming
- Some philosophy and observations in general.
- Way to document any big projects
