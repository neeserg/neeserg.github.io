I am the proud creator of this website. I am a software developer by profession and not very good at talking about myself. But I have made an entire website dedicated to me and my musing, so I guess I will have to do it üòÆ‚Äçüí®.

I guess I will start with the reason I have created this website. I want to be able to share the things I learn on the internet on the internet. This way the hours spent on the net researching interesting little factoids has a purpose. More than that, I think the scattered research will have some direction if I decide to hold it to a standard I deem to be publishable. 

Another reason I started this website is to progress my career as a software developer. I want to do interesting projects, do it on the internet, for everyone to see. This is to keep my skills sharp beyond the work I do at work.

I also think programming is about exploring in some sense the world of platonic ideals. Mathematics is one way to do it, but I think programming somewhat makes it tangible and visible. Gives the problem a sense of finitude. So what I mean is algorithms, data structures, mathematical structures, compression, etc. You know comp-sci shit.

So each of the posts will cover at least 2 out of 3 of these topics. Sometimes all three of them.

So the problems will cover:

- Some topics I am really interested in. ie physics, sports data, language, etc
- Some technology I am interested in. ie Programming languages, frameworks, protocols, libraries, etc
- Some core comp-sci concepts. fast fourier transform, encryption, geometric algorithms, etc.

### About ME
Ok, enough stalling. I am a Nepalese/Australian human being. A somewhat proud member of the human race. I know we have done some terrible things, but hey pretty hard having a conscience and also being stuck with a brain that was designed by evolution to be pretty self-serving. This blog is going to be about positivism and not cynicism.

#### Really about me this time
Ok, enough about my species. About this particular person that inhabits this body. I would say the defining characteristic that defines me, is my thirst for knowledge and my scattered approach to finding the said knowledge.

I did my bachelors in physics, where I tried to pursue a career in physics. I finished but decided it wasn't really for me. I then started a promising career as a car wash attendant where I used my physics knowledge to get that car as shiny as possible. I later realized that maybe being a car washer wasn't for me, just wasn't really too into cars. I still don't know if I was shafted by the last mechanic I went to.

I then read the book `Godel, Escher, Bach` which inspired me to pursue a career in computer science. Cool book, I do really recommend it. I started my computer science journey, and I realized this is a very cool career. Learned a bunch in University about computer science. Artificial Intelligence, Data structures, time complexities, Turing machines, streaming algorithms, bloom filters, stochastic optimization and lots of other cool stuff.
Oh yeah, this is going to be great, I am gonna love working as a coder. But most jobs are just learning the latest framework in Javascript and working on some small sandbox where I shuffle code around. But there are jobs out there, after all, all this framework and sandbox environment underneath the hood is doing some real computer science stuff.

Which brings me to now. I used to be in love with physics, then we broke up :pensive:, and now I am losing the love with coding. Maybe it's not them, maybe it's me :open_mouth:. Maybe I just haven't put enough work in.

### About the blog again

So back to the purpose of this blog again. It is really to do interesting things. To re-align what I do and what I love. You are what you do in life, and you have to love yourself, if you are gonna live with yourself.
