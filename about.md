I am Neeserg Parajuli, and this is my blog. I am creating this blog mainly to document my work and share my projects/thoughts with the world. The content of this blog will generally be self-contained to the following topics:

- The intersection of maths and programming
- Some creative outlet to channel my creativity.
- Some philosophy and observations in general.
- Way to document any big projects
- General opinions on various topics 
- Anything really: no limits on imagination

I will try to focus on quantity over quality, with quality increasing over time due to the quantity. I think focusing on quantity generally forces us not to get stuck on the impossible target of perfection. Perfection is a privilege saved for people who have infinite time at their disposal. I am 30 now, and the finiteness of my life is ever so apparent.

In terms of me. I am a software developer, an avid learner and hopefully a good teacher (with the help of this blog). I have re-written this about page 3 times now, so I know for a fact that my opinions are subject to change. I don't want to say I am a big socialist, capitalist, idealist, materialist, blah blah blah. Hopefully, my blog posts will give a window into my personality. Your words are useless without work, and consequently, work is useless without the ability to communicate aka words. This blog is my marriage between the words and work:).

Neeserg Parajuli.
