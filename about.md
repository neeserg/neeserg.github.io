I am the proud creator of this website. I am a software developer by profession and not very good at talking about myself. But I have made a entire website dedicated to me and my musing, so I guess I will have to do it üòÆ‚Äçüí®.

I guess I will start with the reason I have created this website. I want to be able to share the things I learn on the internet on the internet. This way the hours of time spent on the net researching about interesting little factoid has a purpose. More than that, I think the scattered research will have some direction if I decide to hold it a standard I deem publishable. 

Another reason I started this website is to progress my career as a software developer. I want to do interesting projects, do it on the internet, for everyone to see. This is to keep my skills sharp beyond the work I do at work.

I also think programming is about exploring in some sense the world of platonic ideals. Mathematics is one way to do it, but I think programming somewhat makes it tangible and visible. Gives the problem a sense of finitude. So what I mean is algorithms, data structures, mathematical structures, compression, etc. You know comp-sci shit.

So each of the post will at least 2 out of 3 of these topics. Sometimes all three of it.

So the problems will cover:

- Some topic I am really interested in. ie physics, sports data, language, etc
- Some technology I am interested in. ie Programming language, framework, protocols, libraries, etc
- Some core comp-sci concept. fast fourier transform, encryption, geometric algorithms, etc.

### About ME

Ok enough stalling. I am Nepalese/Australian human being. A somewhat proud member of the human race. I know we done some terrible things, but hey pretty hard having a conscience and also being stuck on brain that was designed by evolution to be pretty self serving. This blog is going to to be about positivism and not cynicism.

#### Really about me this time

Ok enough about my species. About this particular person that inhabits this body. I would say the defining characteristic that defines me, is my thirst for knowledge and my scattered approach to finding the said knowledge.

I did my bachelors in physics, where I tried to pursue a career in physics. I finished but decided it wasn't really for me. I then started a promising career as a car wash attendant where I used my physics knowledge get that car as shiny as possible. I later realised that maybe being car washer wasn't for me, just wasn't too into cars really. I still don't know if I was shafted by the last mechanics I went to.

I then read the book `Godel, Escher, Bach` which inspired me to pursue a career in computer science. Really cool book, I really do recommend it. I started my computer science journey, and I realised this is a very cool career. Learnt a bunch in University about computer science. Artificial Intelligence, Data structures, time complexities, turing machine, streaming algorithms, bloom filters, stochastic optimisation and lots of other cool stuff.

Oh yeah this is going to be great, I am gonna love working as a coder. But most jobs are just learning the latest framework in Javascript and working on some small sandbox where I shuffle code around. But there are jobs out there, after all, all this framework and sandbox environment underneath the hood is doing some real computer science stuff.

Which brings me to now. I used to be in love with physics, then we broke up :pensive:, now I am losing the love with coding. Maybe its not them, maybe its me :open_mouth:. Maybe I just haven't put enough work in.

### About the blog again

So back to the purpose of this blog again. It is really to do interesting things. To re-align what I do and what I love. You are what you do in life, and you have to love yourself, if you are gonna live with yourself.
